# Three Outlook Add-Ins

**1. Attachment Utility (Context Menu)**

This add-in lets you remove and save all attachments from the selected email item(s). When enabled, the options to save and remove attachments are available when right clicking a selection of emails.

**2. Attachment Utility (Ribbon)**

This add-in lets you remove and save all attachments from the selected email item(s). When enabled, the two buttons will appear on the Home tab ribbon.

*Upon using the attachment utility add-ins, a dialog will pop up indicating how many emails of the selected had their attachments saved or removed depending on which button was clicked.*

**3. Save and Send**

This add-in lets the sender choose where they want an email to be stored upon sending it.
